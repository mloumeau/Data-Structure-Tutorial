# Data Structure Tutorial

Hello and welcome to the tutorial about data structures. These three data structures are essential in being an efficient programmer. We'll start off easy, and work our way to more difficult problems.

* [Stacks](https://github.com/mloumeau/Data-Structure-Tutorial/blob/master/1-stacks.md)
* [Sets](https://github.com/mloumeau/Data-Structure-Tutorial/blob/master/2-sets.md)
* [Trees](https://github.com/mloumeau/Data-Structure-Tutorial/blob/master/3-trees.md)

For each module, there will be a description of the data structure, the complexity in terms of big O notation, examples of when it is useful, and a coding challenge. There will be a solution to the coding challenge provided, but should only be viewed after attempting the problem on your own.
